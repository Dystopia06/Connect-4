# Connect-4
A classic game : the connect 4 

Creation of a "connect 4" in collaboration with Clara Cassaigne.

This game is fully coded in Java.
We chose to deal with the session management problem -> You can access any of your games wether you remember of the code you associated to it !
The game also lets you choose your opponent : a computer or your friend.
The code provides some reflections about artificial intelligence for the computer but the main code is left as a comment.
